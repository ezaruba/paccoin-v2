This product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project for use in
the OpenSSL Toolkit (http://www.openssl.org/).  This product includes
cryptographic software written by Eric Young (eay@cryptsoft.com).


Intro
-----
PAcCoin is a free open source project derived from Paccoin, with
the goal of providing a long-term energy-efficient crypto-currency.
Built on the foundation of Paccoin, innovations such as proof-of-stake
help further advance the field of crypto-currency.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run:
 bin/32/paccoin-qt (GUI, 32-bit)
 bin/32/paccoind (headless, 32-bit)
 bin/64/paccoin-qt (GUI, 64-bit)
 bin/64/paccoind (headless, 64-bit)

The software automatically finds other nodes to connect to.  You can
enable Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) with your router/firewall
or forward port 9901 (TCP) to your computer so you can receive
incoming connections.  PAcCoin works without incoming connections,
but allowing incoming connections helps the PAcCoin network.

All your existing coins/transactions should be intact with the upgrade.
To upgrade from 0.3, first backup wallet
paccoind backupwallet <destination_backup_file>

paccoind stop
Uninstall v0.3 client, download and install v0.4 client.

Intro
-----
Paccoin is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is
completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.
